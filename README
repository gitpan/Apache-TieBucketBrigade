Apache-TieBucketBrigade version 0.01
====================================

Apache::TieBucketBrigade ties an IO::Handle to an Apache 2 bucket brigade 
in order to make building protocol handlers much simpler.

The test suite sucks, but I'm releasing to code anyway.  Hopefully I'll figure
out how to use Apache::Test to test protocol handlers soon.  For now you'll
have to test manually with Apache::TestTieBucketBrigade (included).
